Welcome to the source code for VU Amsterdam Research Support Handbook! If you want to report a problem or suggest a new page, [you can do so using our contribution portal](https://ez-github-contributor.netlify.app/).

## What is this?

This is a community led handbook for all things related to research at VU. The handbook is split into **topics** and **guides**.

> [Topics](https://ubvu.github.io/open-handbook/topics.html) - self-contained descriptions of specific things relevant to your work at VU Amsterdam.

> [Guides](https://ubvu.github.io/open-handbook/guides.html) - a collection of topics in a meaningful order to achieve a goal

All information in the handbook is specific to VU's local context. We are happy to hear if things are (un)helpful and you work at VU Amsterdam.

## Blog

The handbook also [has a blog](https://ubvu.github.io/open-handbook/blog.html), which you can [follow on RSS](https://ubvu.github.io/open-handbook/blog.xml). If you'd like to write a blog post, you are more than welcome to share it with us.

Our requirements for blogs:

* It articulates its relevance to VU employees
* It has a clear message and communicates it effectively
* It is clear and concise

We will assess blogs on a case by case basis before including them. Please mind that we may not immediately post your blog and submitting one does not entitle you to it being posted.
