Windows users can use [WebDrive](https://webdrive.com/) to access their data,
as an alternative to the [native WebDAV client](./yoda_using_windowsexplorer.qmd). 
With WebDrive the Yoda WebDAV interface can be connected via as a drive in 
Windows Explorer. 

As a VU user you can download a licensed version of WebDrive from [download.vu.nl](https://download.vu.nl).

Note that you should always [disable caching](#disable-the-cache) in WebDrive!

## How to: Using WebDrive

1. Start Webdrive from the Desktop icon or the Start menu.

- You should now see the Yoda Disk in your Windows Explorer.

## How To: Disable the cache
By default WebDrive enables a caching mechanism and suggests this as a way to enable syncing and working offline.   
This functionality is not implemented very well and you should **always disable** this to prevent data loss.
