Yoda uses a notification system to notify you when the status of a data package that was submitted for [archiving](/tools/yoda/vault_archive.qmd) or [publishing](/tools/yoda/vault_publish.qmd) changes.

If you have unread notifications a Bell sign will be visible next to your email address on the top right button. You can view notifications by clicking on the Notifications button.
