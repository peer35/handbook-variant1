This page provides an overview of the Yoda functionality you can access through the [Yoda Web Portal](https://portal.yoda.vu.nl).
Before getting started, a project space must be created and a user account moet be added by the Yoda administrator before a user has access to Yoda. Whilst Yoda leverages on a user’s VUnetID as an authentication and identification mechanism, single sign-on (SSO), users should always use their primary e-mail address to login to the system.

### Group Manager
Yoda allows you to store your valuable research data in a secure way.  The data is kept in data folders,
which can only be accessed by members of the associated research Group.

The Group Manager can be used to view a list of research Groups and their members. People with a "group manager" role
can add members to a research Group, remove them, and change their roles.

See: [Managing groups, users and access rights](./group_manager.qmd)


### Research (active data)
The main folder ("research-...") contains current research data that researchers
collaborate on. Data is kept in subfolders. The subfolders can be organized according
to the needs of the research Group.

You can also drag-and-drop files to your research folder or download individual files.

You can [Add metadata](/tools/yoda/workflow_metadata.qmd) to a folder at any time to describe the dataset contained in that folder and its subfolders.

When you know a (subset of) your data must be [archived](/topics/data-archiving.qmd) for the long term, the data in a subfolder can be [submitted to the Yoda Vault](/tools/yoda/vault_archive.qmd) so that it is kept for 10 years or longer. 

### Vault (archived data)
The folder named "vault-..." contains these deposited data packages. Data in the Vault cannot be deleted and the research Group has read access.

Researchers can opt to (but do not have to) [publish](/tools/yoda/vault_publish.qmd) any of the vault deposited data packages
to make the metadata of a data package known to the research community at large. 

Yoda adds a DOI persistent identifier to published data so that the data package can be cited
and found in catalogs such as Datacite, Narcis, B2Find etcetera.

If (and only if) the data has been classified as "open" then the content itself can be downloaded
by anyone from the internet. Otherwise, only the metadata description can be viewed.
